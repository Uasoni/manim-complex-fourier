# manim-complex-fourier

Note that this code was from TheoremOfBeethoven, for an older version of manim - namely ManimGL.

You can find it on the official repository for Manim, and install either with git or pip.
If you are installing it, it is recommended to do so in a virtual environment just so your current manim installation does not get corrupted by overwritten files, etc.

The scenes for the video are not attached due to a misplacement of code. If you have no idea what is going on, not only is that completely understandable, but go see TheoremOfBeethoven's channel (outdated) for a tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tTshwWTEic&ab_channel=TheoremofBeethoven

If the code I used for the video resurfaces again, I will update the repository, but chances of that are pretty slim.
